# 📧 Spam Detection System (Agent-Based ML)

A machine learning–based **Spam vs Not Spam detection system** built with an **agent-oriented architecture**.  
This project demonstrates how multiple agents can collaborate to preprocess data, extract features, train models, and evaluate results.

## 🧠 Project Architecture

### 🔹 Agents Overview
- **Data Preprocessor Agent** – Cleans and normalizes text
- **Feature Extractor Agent** – Converts text to numerical features
- **Trainer Agent** – Trains the ML model
- **Evaluator Agent** – Evaluates accuracy and performance
- **Predictor Agent** – Predicts spam or not spam for new input
